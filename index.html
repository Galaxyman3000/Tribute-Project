        <p>Israel has developed from a ancient nation filled with a deep history of the past to a tech giant in a matter of 74 years. Israel is now known as Start-Up Nation. Many Israeli inventions have changed the world around us forever.
            In the following article, we've collected 10 recent and past examples of inventions we feel stand out from the rest.</p>

            <h2>Technology</h2>
                    <h3>USB</h3>
                        <img class="media" src="./Resources/Media/Images/USB.jpg" alt="USB">
                            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pIZREjck9jg" target="blank">USB</a>. The first ever patent for what we know today as the USB flash disk was an Israeli one. Whilst the main components were developed by Toshiba in the 1980s and a U.S. industry coalition in the 1990s with the Universal Serial Bus (USB), it wasn't until 1999 that M-Systems packaged them together.
                            This kicked off the development and production of this ubiquitous device around the world.</p>
        
                    <h3>Firewall</h3>
                    <img class="media" src="./Resources/Media/Images/Firewall.jpg">
                            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDEX1HXybrU&t=2s" target="blank">Firewall</a>. The first commercially viable Firewall software was first developed in 1993 by a team of Israeli computer scientists at Check Point Software Technologies. Since then, Check Point has expanded, opening subsidiaries overseas and partnering with major tech companies, including Nokia.
                                This type of software is the cornerstone of most computer security systems and keeps millions of people a little safer from malicious cyber activity. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Instant Messaging</h3>
                        <img class="media" src="./Resources/Media/Images/IM.jpg" alt="chat">
                            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICQ" target="blank">Instant Messaging</a>. ICQ was one of the first standalone Instant Messaging (IM) systems to be developed in the world. It was first released in 1996 by Israeli software company Mirabilis and was free-to-download.
                                It became a huge success and was later sold to AOL in 1998 for just over $400 million and later to Mail.Ru Group in 2010.</p>

                    <h3>Mobileye</h3>
                        <img class="media" src="./Resources/Media/Images/mobileye.jpg" alt="radar">
                            <p><a href="https://www.mobileye.com/" target="blank"><br>Mobileye</a> was developed in 1999 by Israeli inventor Amon Shashua. It was the product of his academic thesis on machine learning and is a revolutionary car technology.<br>
                                Mobileye systems consist of tiny cameras that are placed in cars to alert drivers of potential hazards like pedestrians or other obstacles. It has since been integrated into many cars around the world and has been adopted by over 25 automobile makers.
                                It has helped save many lives.</p>

                    <h3>Waze</h3>
                        <img class="media" src="./Resources/Media/Images/waze.png" alt="gps">
                            <p><a href="https://www.waze.com/" target="blank">Waze</a> is a GPS system on steroids. Rather than just guiding a user from A to B it actually helps you avoid roadblocks and traffic.<br>
                                It was first developed by Israeli Ehud Shabati after he first used, and was quickly disappointed by existing GPS systems. Waze, once built,<br> was an instant hit and has since been sold to Google for over $1 Billion dollars in 2013.
                                Today it provides real-time traffic information for millions of users around the world.</p>

                    <h3>Rewalk</h3>
                    <img class="media" src="./Resources/Media/Images/rewalk.jpg" alt="Robot">
                        <p><a href="https://rewalk.com/" target="blank">Rewalk</a> is a battery-powered exoskeleton that has been developed to help paraplegic patients walk again. It's inventor, Dr. Amit Goffer, devised the system after being left paralyzed due to a tragic accident.
                        The exoskeleton is operated using a wristwatch and allows patients to recover the ability to walk, stand up and climb stairs. It has been available to the public since 2014 and has even made appearances in the London Marathon and Paralympics. </p>

                    <h3>Pill Cam</h3>
                        <img class="media" src="./Resources/Media/Images/pillcam.jpg" alt="pill cam">
                            <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bcHcTUWVjww" target="blank">Pillcam</a>, as the name suggests, is a camera device that is designed to be swallowed. It was developed to help diagnose and treat infections, such as intestinal disorders, and digestive system cancers.
                                Data is transmitted from the camera to an external receiver and it is a revolutionizing medicine.
                                The camera is digestible and disposable and is now FDA-approved for use. Because of its unique design, it is able to access areas of the digestive system that are typically out of range during a conventional procedure.</p>

                    <h3>EluNir</h3>
                            <img class="media" src="./Resources/Media/Images/NluNiR.jpg" alt="Wire">

The flexible stent has helped save millions of people's lives since it was first developed in 1996. This tube-shaped device is used to open up arteries to help treat coronary heart disease in patients.
                                This helps avoid the need for open-heart surgery and all the complications that come with it. They have widely replaced more traditional rigid stents and made surgery easier and safer.</p>

                    <h3>Netafim</h3>
                        <img class="media" src="./Resources/Media/Images/Netafim.jpg" alt="Farming">
                            <p><a href="https://www.netafim.com/en/" target="blank">Netafim</a> is an innovative drip irrigation system that was developed by Israeli inventor and engineer Simcha Blass in the 1960s. He thought about the idea when observing adjacent trees whereby one was noticeably larger than the other.
                            On investigation, he discovered that the larger tree was sited next to a damaged water pipe. He was astonished to realize that just a small amount of regularly dripping water could make a huge difference to plant growth.
                            Netafilm was soon developed and by 1967 had increased crop yields by 70% in Israel. The technology soon spread around the world.</p>

                    <h3>Watergen</h3>

                                <p><a href="https://us.watergen.com/" target="blank">Watergen</a> is technology straight out of Sci-Fi. It allows water to be condensed out of thin air and might conjure up images of the moisture farms of Tatooine in Star Wars: A New Hope.<br>
                                    Developed in the later 2000s,  Watergen's generators cool and liquidize the air vapor, producing up to four liters of water for every kilowatt-hour of electricity they use.<br>
                                    Today, it can be found in many disaster zones around the world and it is hoped to be rolled out around the world to provide drinking water for millions of people.</p>
